I developed a **Boardroom Booking System** designed to simplify the scheduling and management of meeting spaces. The system enables users to view available boardrooms, book slots seamlessly, and receive instant confirmations. It includes features such as calendar integration, conflict detection to avoid double bookings, and user authentication for secure access. The backend, built with PHP and MySQL, ensures efficient data handling, while the frontend offers a user-friendly interface for smooth navigation. This project streamlined operations, improved resource utilization, and enhanced the overall booking experience for users.
